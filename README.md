# DragDropGame

## Game Logic:
1. Once the game starts:
    1. Timer starts at the top with 20 seconds along with shapes left to match
    2. A shape appears at the bottom placeholder along with a unique set of shapes on the screen
    3. The player must match shape with the shapes on screen
    4. The shape that is matched - dissapears from the screen and a new shape to match appears at the bottom of the screen
    5. With each level a new shape gets added to the the screen
    6. There are a total of 20 levels

## The app will showcase:

- Clean architecture
- MVVM
- Kotlin coroutines + Room
- Kotlin collections
