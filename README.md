# DragDropGame

## Game Logic:
1. Once the game starts:
    1. Timer starts at the top with 10 seconds along with shapes left to match
    2. A shape appears at the bottom placeholder along with a unique set of shapes on the screen
    3. The player must match shape with the shapes on screen
    4. The shape that is matched - dissapears from the screen
    5. With each level a new shape gets added to the the screen
    6. There are a total of 20 levels

## The app will showcase:

1. Clean architecture
2. MVVM
3. Kotlin coroutines + Firestore
4. Kotlin collections
